## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Configurable tool messages** - New global `toolMessages` settings control
  whether tool calls, compact arguments, and selected tool outputs are returned
  to chat. Presentation modes include `off`, immutable `events`, editable
  current `status`, and an editable cumulative `trace`. Editable modes work
  across WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Mattermost, Matrix, and Web, with
  progressive ACP argument updates, trace pagination, and edit-failure
  recovery. The former `streamTools` option is migrated automatically.
- **Telegram file attachments from users** - The Telegram connector now
  downloads photos, documents, videos, audio, voice notes, animations
  (GIFs), video notes, and stickers that users send to the bot. Each
  attachment is saved to `<session-cwd>/uploads/` and its absolute path is
  prepended to the LLM prompt (alongside the user's caption) so the LLM
  can use `read`, `bash`, `glob`, or other tools to inspect the file.
  Telegram Bot API's 20 MB-per-file download limit is enforced up-front;
  oversized files are skipped with a log line and the message is still
  processed. Caption-less media in DMs (or inside active forum topics)
  count as engagement and bypass the trigger requirement.
- **Telegram connector** - New connector using the Telegram Bot API over HTTPS
  with native `fetch` and long-polling `getUpdates`. Zero external runtime
  dependencies, no public port or webhook required. Features:
  - Trigger-prefixed messages (`!oc ...`), `@`-mentions of the bot, and
    auto-handled DMs (no prefix required in private chats)
  - Per-topic session isolation in forum supergroups, configurable via
    `threadIsolation` in `chat-bridge.json` (default `true`); each topic gets
    its own isolated OpenCode session
  - Plain replies inside an active topic continue the conversation without
    requiring a re-mention (mirrors the behavior of the Slack/Mattermost
    thread-isolation feature)
  - Native image (`sendPhoto`) and document (`sendDocument`) uploads for
    outputs from OpenCode tools
  - Long-message splitting at the 4096-char Telegram limit
  - `sendChatAction` "typing..." indicator while OpenCode is processing
  - Automatic exponential-backoff polling with `retry_after` honored for 429s
  - `allowedUsers` / `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` allowlist plus `ignoreChats`
    and `ignoreUsers` blocklists
  - `TELEGRAM_DROP_PENDING=1` to skip messages queued while offline
  - Swipe-replies to one of this bot's own messages are forwarded without
    a trigger/`@`-mention, gated on an active session so stale replies are
    ignored. Toggle with `telegram.respondToReplies` (default `true`).
    Fixes [#34](https://github.com/ominiverdi/opencode-chat-bridge/issues/34).
- **Universal user allowlists (Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, Discord, Mattermost, Telegram)** -
  Each connector now supports `allowedUsers` in `chat-bridge.json` plus
  per-connector `*_ALLOWED_USERS` env vars. Messages from unlisted users are
  silently dropped. Feature originated from PR #28 by @llvilanova and was
  generalized across all connectors.
- **Thread isolation (Slack, Mattermost, Matrix, Telegram)** - Sessions are now keyed per thread (`channel:threadTs` for Slack/Mattermost,
  `room:$eventId` for Matrix, or `chatId:messageThreadId` for Telegram forum
  topics) instead of per channel. Each thread gets its own isolated OpenCode
  session. Replies always stay in threads. Implicit follow-ups work without
  re-mentioning the bot. Configurable via `threadIsolation` in
  chat-bridge.json (default: true).
  Inspired by PR #2, reimplemented with proper separation of concerns.
- **Event deduplication (all connectors)** - New `EventDeduplicator` in BaseConnector
  prevents duplicate event processing. Tracks recently seen event IDs with automatic
  eviction. Protects against Slack retries, Matrix sync replays, Discord
  re-deliveries, and Mattermost WebSocket replays.
- **Active query guard (all connectors)** - Prevents concurrent queries on the same
  session. Users get a clear "request already running" message. Sessions with
  in-flight queries are protected from expiry.
- **Runtime session expiry** - New `SESSION_RETENTION_MINS` config (default: 30 for
  Slack). Background sweep loop expires inactive in-memory sessions and cleans up
  their on-disk cache directories. Coexists with existing `SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS`
  startup cleanup.
- **Document attachment support (WhatsApp)** - New `[DOCLIBRARY_DOC]` marker and
  `sendDocumentFromFile` method for sending PDF, CSV, XLSX, and other document
  types as native WhatsApp file attachments. Same pattern as image handling.
  Shared utilities (`extractDocPaths`, `removeDocMarkers`) and reusable
  `DocHandler` class available for other connectors.
- **Mattermost connector** - New connector using Mattermost REST API v4 and
  WebSocket for real-time events. Zero external dependencies (uses native
  `fetch` and `WebSocket`). Features: trigger-based responses in channels,
  DM support without trigger, image file uploads, long message splitting,
  tool output streaming, automatic reconnection with backoff.
- **HTML message formatting for Matrix** - New `formatHtml` config option converts
  markdown responses to HTML using `marked`, sending both `formatted_body` (HTML)
  and `body` (plain text fallback) per the Matrix spec. Tables, bold, lists, and
  code blocks render natively in Matrix clients. Disabled by default.
- **MCP server environment variables** - MCP servers defined in `opencode.json` can
  now include an `env` block for passing configuration (API URLs, tokens,
  feature flags) to the server process.
- **Streaming tool output** - Tool output now streams in real-time during execution.
  Requires [opencode PR #13589](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/13589).
  - Configurable via `streamTools` in `chat-bridge.json` (default: `["bash"]`)
  - Only tools in the list have output streamed to chat
  - Properly computes deltas from cumulative output (fixes accumulation bug)
  - Skips final tool result if already streamed
- **OpenCode commands forwarding** - Commands like `/init`, `/compact`, `/review`
  are discovered from OpenCode via ACP and shown in `/help`. When invoked, they
  are forwarded directly to OpenCode instead of being handled by the bridge.
- **Skills infrastructure** - The `.opencode/skills/` directory is symlinked to
  session directories, allowing custom skills to be loaded via the `skill` tool.
  Skills provide domain-specific instructions (e.g., weather formatting, personas).
- **Permission request handling** - Properly handles OpenCode permission requests
  - Auto-rejects with clear message (e.g., "Permission denied: write")
  - Prevents hanging when tools require elevated permissions
  - Shows both the permission denial and the tool error to users

### Changed
- **Security dependency refresh** - Updated Baileys to `7.0.0-rc.13`,
  Discord.js to `14.27.0`, Slack Bolt to `4.7.3`, and Marked to `17.0.6`.
  This removes the audited Baileys protocol-message vulnerability and several
  vulnerable transitive networking and parsing packages.
- **Breaking config rename (WhatsApp)** - `allowedNumbers` and
  `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` were removed in favor of `allowedUsers` and
  `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` to match all other connectors.
### Fixed
- **Telegram: bot never answered swipe-replies to its own messages**
  (#34) - Added `telegram.respondToReplies` (default `true`) and a
  `shouldHandleTelegramBotReply` decision branch in the Telegram connector so
  long-pressing the bot's message and tapping "Reply" continues the
  conversation even in regular groups without a forum topic. Match is keyed
  on the parent message's `from.id`, so replies to other bots (or to
  messages where Telegram redacts `from`) are ignored, and the connector
  only engages when an active session exists for the chat/topic.
- **Trigger env var inconsistency** - All connectors now support per-connector
  trigger overrides (`SLACK_TRIGGER`, `MATTERMOST_TRIGGER`, etc.) with fallback
  to `chat-bridge.json`. Previously only Slack and Discord had env overrides.

### Changed
- **Generic tool activity formatting** - Tool activity messages now show
  `key=value, key=value [toolname]` for ANY tool, removing hardcoded formatting.
  This ensures new MCP tools display useful context automatically.
- Added `marked` as a dependency for markdown-to-HTML conversion

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **E2EE support for Matrix** - Bot now works in encrypted rooms
- Native Rust crypto via `matrix-bot-sdk` with SQLite key persistence
- Password-based login with automatic token caching

### Changed
- **Replaced `matrix-js-sdk` with `matrix-bot-sdk`** - cleaner API, built-in E2EE
- Removed `indexeddbshim` and `@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm` dependencies
- Simplified Matrix connector code (~40% smaller)
- Requires Node.js 22+ (for native crypto bindings)

### Fixed
- E2EE key persistence across restarts (was in-memory only)
- Crypto storage now uses native SQLite instead of IndexedDB polyfills

### Notes
- "Unverified device" warning is cosmetic - E2EE works correctly
- Cross-signing requires manual verification from Element (UIA limitation)
- Back up `~/.local/share/opencode-matrix-bot/` for crypto key persistence

- Session storage moved to `~/.cache/opencode-chat-bridge/sessions/` (outside git repo)
- Improved `/status` output (removed directory path, added token estimates)
- Documentation now uses generic MCP examples (time, weather, web-search)

### Fixed
- **Security: Added `write` tool to deny list** - was missing and allowed file creation
