# Matrix Connector Architecture Decision

## Why Simple Login Instead of Application Service?

Issue [#1](https://github.com/ominiverdi/opencode-chat-bridge/issues/1) raised the question of using Matrix Application Services instead of simple username/password login.

### Research Summary

**Application Services are designed for bridges** that need to:
- Create virtual/puppet users (e.g., `@irc_alice:server`, `@telegram_bob:server`)
- Reserve user ID namespaces exclusively
- Lazily create rooms on-the-fly
- Handle hundreds of virtual users without rate limits
- Receive events via HTTP push instead of polling

**Our use case is a chat bot**, not a bridge:
- Single bot identity responding as itself
- No virtual users needed
- No namespace reservation required
- Polling (sync API) works fine for a single bot

### Trade-offs

| Aspect              | Simple Login                           | Application Service                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Setup complexity    | Username/password                      | Registration YAML + homeserver config |
| Server requirements | Any Matrix account                     | Homeserver admin access required      |
| Accessibility       | Works on matrix.org, any public server | Self-hosted servers only              |
| Virtual users       | No                                     | Yes                                   |
| Rate limits         | Standard                               | Exempt                                |
| Event delivery      | Polling (sync)                         | HTTP push (webhooks)                  |
| Best for            | Bots, assistants                       | Protocol bridges                      |

### Decision

**Simple login is the correct approach** for opencode-chat-bridge because:

1. **Accessibility** - Users can run the bot with any Matrix account, including on public servers like matrix.org. Application services require server admin access, limiting adoption to self-hosted setups.

2. **Simplicity** - No need to generate registration files, configure homeserver YAML, or set up webhook endpoints.

3. **Appropriate scope** - We're a single bot, not a bridge creating puppet users. Application services would be architectural overkill.
