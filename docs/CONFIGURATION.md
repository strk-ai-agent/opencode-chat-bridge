# Configuration Reference

This document describes all configuration options for opencode-chat-bridge.

## Quick Setup

1. Copy `chat-bridge.json.example` to `chat-bridge.json` and edit local bridge settings
2. Create `opencode.json` with the `chat-bridge` agent
3. Run `bun src/cli.ts`

`chat-bridge.json` is intentionally ignored by git. Keep deployment-specific connector settings, local paths, and credentials there. Commit safe defaults or examples to `chat-bridge.json.example` instead.

## ACP backend

The bridge can launch any ACP v1 stdio agent. Configure the executable, argument vector, stable backend identity, and optional workspace profile in `chat-bridge.json`:

```json
{
  "sessionStorePath": "./.opencode/chat-sessions.json",
  "acp": {
    "command": "/usr/local/bin/ferrum",
    "args": ["acp"],
    "backendId": "ferrum",
    "profileDir": "./profiles/ferrum-chat"
  }
}
```

Each connector/thread receives a deterministic working directory. The profile is copied into that directory before the ACP process starts, so it can provide backend-specific policy, instructions, and skills. The bridge persists `sessionId`, canonical `cwd`, and `backendId` in `sessionStorePath`; it resumes matching sessions after restart and deletes the mapping and backend session on `/clear`.

`backendId` must change when the configured backend or its incompatible session format changes. ACP processes inherit the bridge environment; keep credentials outside profiles and the session store.

### Ferrum backend notes

[Ferrum](https://codeberg.org/ominiverdi/ferrum) is a small Rust-native Linux coding agent. It can be used directly as an ACP v1 stdio backend:

```bash
ferrum acp
```

Ferrum is useful for chat bot deployments because it starts quickly, has low runtime overhead, persists durable JSONL sessions, and has explicit tool policy. The bridge has been validated with Ferrum for executable/argument selection, per-thread workspaces, text and thought streaming, command discovery, cancellation, process restart, session resume/delete, and restrictive workspace policy.

A typical Ferrum chat profile keeps broad local authority off by default and exposes specific capabilities through MCP:

```toml
mcp_enabled = true

[tools]
deny = ["write", "edit", "bash", "wait"]
writable_roots = ["."]

[[mcp.servers]]
name = "search"
command = "/usr/local/bin/search-mcp"
args = []
enabled = true
```

Useful Ferrum features for this setup:

- `AGENTS.md` context loading and Agent Skills-style instruction packages
- configurable providers, models, thinking, safety, and context budget
- OpenAI-compatible providers and ChatGPT/Codex OAuth
- bounded native tools for file access, search, editing, and shell execution
- allow/deny tool exposure policy
- stdio MCP client support with namespaced tools
- project-local `.ferrum/config.toml` restrictions for tools, roots, skills, MCP access, safety, and tool-round limits

Ferrum is not a sandbox: an allowed tool or MCP server runs with the Unix permissions of the Ferrum process. Its safety model is still meaningful. Native tools and shell execution are bounded and policy-checked; writable roots and safety tiers limit mutation; MCP servers get a filtered environment, explicit env allowlists, bounded protocol frames/schema/output, stderr withholding from model-visible errors, sanitized tool-name collision checks, transport quarantine on framing failure, and Linux process-tree cleanup through delegated cgroup-v2 when available.

For production chat bots, configure only trusted MCP commands, pass only required environment variables, keep credentials outside copied profiles and session stores, and prefer narrow MCP tools over enabling general shell access.

## Session picker

The project/session picker is disabled by default because it exposes saved ACP working directories, session titles, and optional recent history previews.

Enable it explicitly:

```json
{
  "sessionPicker": {
    "enabled": true,
    "connectors": ["whatsapp"],
    "mirrorIntervalSeconds": 60
  }
}
```

Commands when enabled:

```text
/p, /p <n>      list/select saved working directories
/s, /s <n>      list/select saved sessions interactively
/m, /m <n>      stop/start read-only mirror mode
/r              reload current selected session
/d              detach without deleting the backend session
```

`connectors` limits where the picker is available. If empty, all connectors may use it. Keep it disabled for shared rooms unless the session paths and history are safe to expose there.

## opencode.json (OpenCode backend)

The `opencode.json` file defines the secure OpenCode agent configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "default_agent": "chat-bridge",
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      "description": "Secure chat assistant",
      "mode": "primary",
      "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant. You can search the web and check time.",
      "permission": {
        "read": "deny",
        "edit": "deny",
        "bash": "deny",
        "glob": "deny",
        "grep": "deny",
        "task": "deny",
        "todowrite": "deny",
        "todoread": "deny",
        "webfetch": "deny",
        "codesearch": "deny",
        "question": "allow",
        "time_*": "allow",
        "weather_*": "allow",
        "web-search_*": "allow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `default_agent` | Agent used by default for new sessions |
| `agent.*.mode` | `"primary"` for main agents, `"subagent"` for helpers |
| `agent.*.prompt` | System prompt for the agent |
| `agent.*.permission` | Tool permissions (allow/deny/ask) |

## Permission Configuration

### Permission Actions

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `"allow"` | Tool executes immediately |
| `"deny"` | Tool blocked, error returned to LLM |
| `"ask"` | Requires user confirmation |

For chat bots, use `"allow"` or `"deny"`. The `"ask"` action requires interactive confirmation.

### Tool Names

Built-in tools:
- `read` - Read files
- `edit` - Edit files
- `bash` - Execute commands
- `glob` - Find files
- `grep` - Search file contents
- `task` - Spawn subagents
- `todowrite` - Write todos
- `todoread` - Read todos
- `webfetch` - Fetch URLs
- `codesearch` - Search code
- `question` - Ask user questions

### MCP Tool Permissions

MCP tools use the pattern `<server>_<tool>`:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "time_*": "allow",
    "weather_*": "allow",
    "web-search_*": "allow"
  }
}
```

**Wildcard matching:** `*` matches any characters, so `weather_*` allows all weather tools.

### Available MCP Servers

Check installed MCP servers:

```bash
opencode mcp list
```

Common servers:

| Server | Tools |
|--------|-------|
| `time` | `time_get_current_time`, `time_convert_time` |
| `weather` | `weather_get_weather`, `weather_get_forecast`, `weather_search_location` |
| `web-search` | `web-search_full-web-search`, `web-search_get-web-search-summaries`, `web-search_get-single-web-page-content` |
| `chrome-devtools` | Browser automation (deny for chat bots) |

Any MCP server can be used. Check available servers with `opencode mcp list`.

### Disabling MCP Servers Locally

Your global OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) may have MCP servers enabled that you don't want the chat bot to use. You can disable them in your local project config.

**Problem:** Global config has `chrome-devtools` enabled, but you don't want the chat bot to use it.

**Solution:** Add an `mcp` section to your project's `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "default_agent": "chat-bridge",
  
  "mcp": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  },
  
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- Local config **overrides** global config
- You only need to specify `"enabled": false"` - not the full server definition
- Other MCP servers (time, weather, web-search) remain enabled from global config

**Important:** Disabling the MCP server prevents tools from being loaded. But the model may still "think" it has access if tools were visible in a previous session. For complete blocking, combine with permission denials:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "chrome-devtools": { "enabled": false }
  },
  
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      "permission": {
        "chrome-devtools_*": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The wildcard `chrome-devtools_*` denies ALL tools from that MCP server.

### Disabling a Whole MCP Server vs Single Functions

There are two ways to block MCP tools:

#### Method 1: Disable the Entire MCP Server

Use the `mcp` section to prevent the server from loading at all:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

This completely disables ALL tools from that server. The tools won't be loaded or visible to the model.

#### Method 2: Deny Individual Functions

Use the `permission` section to block specific tools while keeping others:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      "permission": {
        "weather_set_default_location": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This allows most weather tools but blocks the one that saves state.

#### Method 3: Wildcard Deny All Functions from an MCP

Use `*` to deny all tools from a server without disabling it:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      "permission": {
        "chrome-devtools_*": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Comparison

| Goal | Method | Config |
|------|--------|--------|
| Block entire MCP server | MCP disable | `"mcp": { "server": { "enabled": false } }` |
| Block all tools from MCP | Wildcard deny | `"permission": { "server_*": "deny" }` |
| Block one specific tool | Single deny | `"permission": { "server_tool": "deny" }` |
| Allow one tool, block rest | Selective | `"server_*": "deny"` + `"server_tool": "allow"` |

#### Example: Allow Only Some web-search Tools

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "web-search_*": "deny",
    "web-search_get-web-search-summaries": "allow"
  }
}
```

This denies all web-search tools by default, then explicitly allows only the lightweight summary search.

### Why Both MCP Disable AND Permission Deny?

| Method | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `mcp.enabled: false` | Server not loaded, tools don't appear |
| `permission: deny` | Tools blocked at execution time |

Using both provides defense in depth:
1. MCP disable prevents tools from loading
2. Permission deny blocks execution if tools somehow load
3. The model won't list capabilities it can't use



## Skills

Skills are custom instruction sets that the AI can load via the `skill` tool.
They provide domain-specific context, formatting preferences, or personas.

### Creating Skills

Skills live in `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:

```
.opencode/
  skills/
    weather/
      SKILL.md
    assistant/
      SKILL.md
```

**Example skill** (`.opencode/skills/weather/SKILL.md`):

```markdown
# Weather Skill

When reporting weather, always include:
- Temperature in Celsius
- Wind speed and direction
- Humidity percentage

Format as a markdown table for chat readability.
```

### Enabling Skills

1. Add `skill: allow` to agent permissions in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      "permission": {
        "skill": "allow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. The bridge automatically symlinks `.opencode/` to session directories

3. Users can invoke skills via chat:
```
!oc /weather    # Loads the weather skill
```

### Skills vs Commands vs Tools

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Skills** | `.opencode/skills/` | Instructions loaded by AI via `skill` tool |
| **Commands** | `.opencode/commands/` | Prompts invoked with `/name`, shown in /help |
| **Tools** | `.opencode/tools/` | Code the AI can execute |

### Notes

- Skills are local config - don't commit secrets to git
- The `.opencode/` directory is gitignored by default
- Skills require both `skill: allow` permission and the symlink setup

## Tool Messages

`toolMessages` controls which tool activity the bridge returns to the chat
channel. Tool authorization remains part of the ACP backend security profile;
these settings affect presentation only.

```json
{
  "toolMessages": {
    "mode": "events",
    "showCalls": true,
    "showArguments": false,
    "showOutputFor": ["bash"],
    "maxTraceEntries": 20
  }
}
```

- `mode` selects the tool-call presentation:
  - `off` hides tool calls.
  - `events` sends one immutable message per call and is the default.
  - `status` maintains one editable message with the current tool and totals.
  - `trace` maintains one editable cumulative tool-call ledger.
- `showCalls` is the legacy call-notice switch. `false` always resolves to
  `mode: "off"`; existing configurations remain compatible.
- `showArguments` adds up to three compact arguments to each call notice.
  Arguments can contain local paths, queries, URLs, or other sensitive input,
  so the default is `false`.
- `showOutputFor` lists tool-name substrings whose output is returned to chat.
  The default `["bash"]` provides progress from shell commands. Use an empty
  list to suppress all direct tool output.
- `maxTraceEntries` bounds each `trace` message. Longer traces continue in
  additional editable messages without discarding earlier calls.

Editable `status` and `trace` messages are supported by WhatsApp, Telegram,
Slack, Discord, Mattermost, Matrix, and Web. The CLI retains event-style output.

For example, to show tool calls and output from Bash and time MCP tools:

```json
{
  "toolMessages": {
    "mode": "events",
    "showCalls": true,
    "showArguments": false,
    "showOutputFor": ["bash", "mcp__time"]
  }
}
```

To show only the agent's final response:

```json
{
  "toolMessages": {
    "mode": "off",
    "showCalls": true,
    "showArguments": false,
    "showOutputFor": []
  }
}
```

## Matrix HTML Formatting

By default, bot responses are sent as plain text. When `formatHtml` is enabled,
the Matrix connector converts markdown responses to HTML before sending, using
the Matrix `formatted_body` field. Matrix clients render the HTML while plain
text clients (IRC bridges, etc.) see the unformatted fallback.

### Enable in chat-bridge.json

```json
{
  "matrix": {
    "formatHtml": true
  }
}
```

### What it does

| With `formatHtml: false` (default) | With `formatHtml: true` |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `sendText()` - plain text only | `sendMessage()` with `format: org.matrix.custom.html` |
| Markdown syntax visible as raw text | Tables, bold, lists rendered natively |
| Works on all clients equally | HTML for Matrix, plain text fallback for others |

### When to use it

- Enable when your primary audience uses Matrix/Element clients
- Leave disabled for IRC-bridged rooms or plain text environments
- The plain text `body` is always included as a fallback

## CLI Options

```bash
# Interactive mode
bun src/cli.ts

# Single prompt
bun src/cli.ts "What time is it?"
```

### Interactive Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `exit` | Exit the CLI |
| `quit` | Exit the CLI |

## Agent Configuration

### Multiple Agents

Define multiple agents for different purposes:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": {
      "description": "Secure chat assistant",
      "mode": "primary",
      "permission": {
        "read": "deny",
        "bash": "deny"
      }
    },
    "researcher": {
      "description": "Deep research mode",
      "mode": "primary",
      "permission": {
        "web-search_*": "allow"
      }
    },
    "coder": {
      "description": "Code-focused assistant",
      "mode": "primary",
      "permission": {
        "read": "allow",
        "glob": "allow",
        "grep": "allow",
        "edit": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `mode` | `"primary"` or `"subagent"` | `"all"` |
| `description` | Human-readable description | - |
| `prompt` | System prompt | OpenCode default |
| `model` | LLM model override | Config default |
| `temperature` | Response randomness | Model default |
| `permission` | Tool permissions | Config default |

## Model Configuration

### Default Model

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST set the `model` field in `opencode.json`. Without it, OpenCode defaults to `opencode/big-pickle` (a free but less capable model).

Set in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
}
```

### Per-Agent Model

Override for specific agents:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "fast-helper": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
      "permission": { "read": "deny" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

Check available models:

```bash
opencode model list
```

Common models:
- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-*` - Good balance
- `anthropic/claude-opus-4-*` - Most capable
- `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-*` - Fastest
- `openai/gpt-4o` - OpenAI
- `google/gemini-*` - Google

## Environment Variables

### Trigger Prefix

The trigger prefix can be set globally in `chat-bridge.json` or overridden per connector via environment variables:

| Env var | Connector | Fallback |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `SLACK_TRIGGER` | Slack | `chat-bridge.json` trigger |
| `DISCORD_TRIGGER` | Discord | `chat-bridge.json` trigger |
| `MATRIX_TRIGGER` | Matrix | `chat-bridge.json` trigger |
| `MATTERMOST_TRIGGER` | Mattermost | `chat-bridge.json` trigger |
| `WHATSAPP_TRIGGER` | WhatsApp | `chat-bridge.json` trigger |
| `WEB_TRIGGER` | Web | `chat-bridge.json` trigger |

This lets you run multiple connectors with different triggers from the same config.

### Other Variables

```bash
# OpenCode configuration
OPENCODE_MODEL="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
OPENCODE_CONFIG="/path/to/opencode.json"

# For chat connectors
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="syt_..."
DISCORD_TOKEN="..."
```

### User Allowlists

Each chat connector can restrict access to a connector-specific list of user IDs. Empty list means all users are allowed. For WhatsApp, `allowedUsers` filters non-owner senders; the linked WhatsApp account itself is always allowed.

These IDs are platform-native identifiers, not always human-friendly usernames or phone numbers. For example, Slack uses member IDs like `U01ABC123`, while WhatsApp may use a sender ID shown in connector logs.

WhatsApp also supports personal linked-account mode:

```json
{
  "whatsapp": {
    "respondToOthers": false
  }
}
```

When `respondToOthers` is `false`, only messages sent by the linked WhatsApp account can trigger the bot. Messages from other people are ignored even if they use the trigger. WhatsApp self-chat plain text is always accepted as a prompt from the owner; other chats still require the configured trigger.

For WhatsApp personal deployments, prefer `whatsapp.respondToOthers: false` over `allowedUsers`; WhatsApp sender IDs may be LID-style identifiers rather than phone numbers and can be hard to map to contacts.

In `chat-bridge.json`:

```json
{
  "slack": { "allowedUsers": ["U01ABC123", "U02DEF456"] },
  "whatsapp": { "allowedUsers": ["34600111222"] },
  "matrix": { "allowedUsers": ["@alice:matrix.org"] },
  "discord": { "allowedUsers": ["123456789012345678"] },
  "mattermost": { "allowedUsers": ["user-id-1"] }
}
```

Environment variable overrides:

| Env var | Connector |
|---------|-----------|
| `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` | Slack |
| `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` | WhatsApp |
| `WHATSAPP_RESPOND_TO_OTHERS` | WhatsApp owner-only mode (`false` = ignore other people) |
| `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` | Matrix |
| `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` | Discord |
| `MATTERMOST_ALLOWED_USERS` | Mattermost |

Breaking change: WhatsApp now uses `allowedUsers` / `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS`. The older `allowedNumbers` / `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` names were removed.

## Example Configurations

      "permission": {
        "read": "deny",
        "edit": "deny",
        "bash": "deny",
        "glob": "deny",
        "grep": "deny",
        "task": "deny",
        "todowrite": "deny",
        "todoread": "deny",
        "webfetch": "deny",
        "codesearch": "deny",
        "question": "allow",
        
        "chrome-devtools_*": "deny",
        "generate_image": "deny",
        "image_quota": "deny",
        
        "time_*": "allow",
        "weather_*": "allow",
        "web-search_*": "allow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration allows time, weather, and web-search MCP tools while denying all filesystem and dangerous tools.

## Session Management

Bot sessions are stored **outside the project git repo** to prevent them from cluttering your OpenCode session list.

**Why outside the git repo?** OpenCode uses the git root to create a unique project hash. If session directories are inside the repo, all bot sessions end up in the same project hash as your dev sessions. By storing them outside (in `~/.cache/`), OpenCode assigns them to the `global` project instead, keeping them completely separate from your development sessions.

### Session Storage Location

**Default:** `~/.cache/opencode-chat-bridge/sessions/<connector>/<channel-id>/`

**Override:** Set `SESSION_BASE_DIR` environment variable:
```bash
SESSION_BASE_DIR=/path/to/sessions
```

### Session Directory Structure

```
~/.cache/opencode-chat-bridge/sessions/
  slack/
    C0ABC123_1710000000_111/  # Slack thread session (channel:threadTs)
    C0ABC123_1710000000_222/  # Another thread in same channel
  matrix/
    _room1_server.org/  # Matrix room session (special chars sanitized)
  mattermost/
    abc123def456/  # Mattermost channel session
  whatsapp/
    1234567890/   # WhatsApp chat session
```

### Session Cleanup

Sessions are cleaned up in two ways:

**1. Startup cleanup (days-based):**
Old on-disk session directories are deleted when a connector starts.

```bash
# .env
SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=7  # Default: 7 days
```

**2. Runtime expiry (minutes-based):**
A background sweep expires inactive in-memory sessions and removes their on-disk cache.

```bash
# .env
SESSION_RETENTION_MINS=30  # Default: 30 for Slack, unset for others
```

Sessions with active in-flight queries are never evicted. Both mechanisms coexist -- startup cleanup handles long-dead sessions, runtime expiry handles sessions that go stale while the bot is running.

### Session Commands

Users can manage their sessions via chat:

**Slack:**
- `!oc /status` - Show session info and directory location
- `!oc /clear` or `!oc /reset` - Clear session history
- `!oc /help` - Show available commands

**Matrix:**
- `!oc /status` - Show session info
- `!oc /clear` or `!oc /reset` - Clear session history
- `!oc /help` - Show available commands

**Mattermost:**
- `!oc /status` - Show session info
- `!oc /clear` or `!oc /reset` - Clear session history
- `!oc /help` - Show available commands

**WhatsApp:**
- `!oc /status` - Show session info
- `!oc /clear` or `!oc /reset` - Clear session history
- `!oc /help` - Show available commands

### Session Continuity

Each conversation thread maintains its own session. Users can reference previous messages as long as:
1. The session hasn't been manually cleared (`/clear`)
2. The session hasn't expired due to `SESSION_RETENTION_MINS` inactivity
3. The session is less than `SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS` old (on-disk cleanup at startup)
4. The connector hasn't been restarted (in-memory sessions are lost on restart)

For Slack specifically, sessions are per-thread. Other connectors use per-channel/room sessions.

### Debugging Sessions

To inspect a session directory:

```bash
ls -la ~/.cache/opencode-chat-bridge/sessions/slack/C0ABC123/
```

OpenCode stores session data in `~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session/<project-hash>/`. Since bot sessions are outside any git repo, they go to the `global` project (`~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session/global/`) instead of your dev project's hash.

To view session files for a specific bot session:

```bash
cd ~/.cache/opencode-chat-bridge/sessions/slack/C0ABC123
opencode session list
```

This won't pollute your main project session list since it's a different "project" (directory outside git).

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent not found"

Ensure `default_agent` matches an agent name:

```json
{
  "default_agent": "chat-bridge",
  "agent": {
    "chat-bridge": { ... }
  }
}
```

### "Tool blocked"

Check permission configuration. Tool calls are blocked if:
- Tool is set to `"deny"`
- Tool not explicitly allowed and no default `"*": "allow"`

### "No response"

1. Check OpenCode is installed: `opencode --version`
2. Check `opencode.json` exists in working directory
3. Check for errors in output

### "Wrong model being used" / "Big Pickle"

If the bot uses `opencode/big-pickle` instead of your intended model:

1. Add `"model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"` to `opencode.json`
2. Without the `model` field, OpenCode defaults to free models
3. Verify with: `opencode models` to list available models

### "Images not displaying in Matrix"

If MCP tool images aren't showing in Matrix chat:

1. Tool results contain image path markers (e.g., `[DOCLIBRARY_IMAGE]...[/DOCLIBRARY_IMAGE]`)
2. These come in tool_result events, not in response text chunks
3. The Matrix connector captures tool results via `update` events
4. Check logs for `[IMAGE]` messages
