# WhatsApp Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the WhatsApp connector for OpenCode Chat Bridge.

## Overview

The WhatsApp connector uses [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys), a WebSocket-based library that connects directly to WhatsApp's servers. No browser or Puppeteer is required.

**How it works:**
1. On first run, a QR code appears in your terminal
2. Scan it with WhatsApp (Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device)
3. The session is saved locally for automatic reconnection

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

The connector uses these packages (already in package.json):

```bash
bun install
```

Key dependencies:
- `baileys` - WhatsApp Web API
- `qrcode-terminal` - Displays QR code in terminal

## Step 2: Configure Environment (Optional)

The WhatsApp connector works with minimal configuration. Optionally add to `.env`:

```bash
# Message prefix to trigger bot (default: !oc)
WHATSAPP_TRIGGER=!oc

# Restrict bot to specific WhatsApp sender IDs (comma-separated, optional)
# Leave empty to respond to everyone who messages
# Check the connector logs for the [MSG] sender ID; recent WhatsApp accounts may use LID values, not phone numbers.
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=1234567890,999888777666

# Personal linked-account mode: false means only your own WhatsApp messages trigger the bot.
# Other people's messages are ignored even if they use the trigger.
WHATSAPP_RESPOND_TO_OTHERS=false
```

## Step 3: Run the Connector

```bash
bun connectors/whatsapp.ts
```

On first run, you'll see:

```
Starting WhatsApp connector...
  Trigger: !oc
  Bot name: OpenCode Bot
  Auth folder: /path/to/.whatsapp-auth
  Allowed users: ALL (no filter)

Scan this QR code with WhatsApp:
▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄
█ ▄▄▄▄▄ █ ▀▀██▀█ ▄▄▄▄▄ █
...
```

## Step 4: Link WhatsApp

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** > **Linked Devices**
3. Tap **Link a Device**
4. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal

Once linked, you'll see:

```
WhatsApp connected!
Bot user: 1234567890
```

## Step 5: Test the Bot

Send a message to the linked WhatsApp number:

```
!oc hello
!oc what time is it?
!oc search for map projections
```

If you message yourself in WhatsApp using the linked account's self-chat, plain text is treated as a bot prompt without the trigger:

```
what time is it?
search for map projections
```

Plain messages in other chats still require the trigger.

## Usage

### Trigger Prefix

Messages must start with the trigger (default: `!oc`):

```
!oc what time is it in Tokyo?
!oc search the web for climate change
!oc show me page 50 of usgs_snyder
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!oc /help` | Show available commands |
| `!oc /status` | Show session info |
| `!oc /clear` | Reset conversation session |

### Restricting Access

For a personal linked-account bridge, disable responses to other people:

```json
{
  "whatsapp": {
    "respondToOthers": false
  }
}
```

or:

```bash
WHATSAPP_RESPOND_TO_OTHERS=false
```

When `respondToOthers` is `false`, only messages sent by the linked WhatsApp account can trigger the bot. Self-chat plain text still works without the trigger; owner messages in other chats still need the trigger. Other people's messages are ignored even if they use the trigger.

To limit which non-owner senders can use the bot by sender ID, set allowed users:

```bash
# .env
# Use the sender ID shown in connector logs after [MSG]. It may be a LID rather than a phone number.
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=1234567890,999888777666
```

WhatsApp matches connector-native sender IDs for non-owner messages. The linked WhatsApp account is always allowed. In many direct chats the sender ID looks like a phone-like number without the `+` prefix, but some accounts use a different LID-based identifier. If unsure, check the connector logs after the sender sends a message and use the ID shown in `[MSG]` lines.

Breaking change: older builds used `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS`. That name has been removed in favor of the cross-connector `*_ALLOWED_USERS` pattern.

## Session Persistence

The connector saves authentication data to `.whatsapp-auth/` directory. This allows automatic reconnection without scanning the QR code again.

**Important:** Keep this directory secure - it contains your WhatsApp session keys.

The `.whatsapp-auth/` directory is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

## Running as a Service

For production, run the connector in the background:

```bash
# Using nohup
nohup bun connectors/whatsapp.ts > logs/whatsapp.log 2>&1 &

# Or with systemd (create a service file)
# Or with pm2
pm2 start "bun connectors/whatsapp.ts" --name whatsapp-bot
```

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Appearing

If the QR code doesn't display properly:
1. Make sure your terminal supports Unicode
2. Try a different terminal emulator
3. Check the logs for errors

### "Connection Closed" / Disconnected

WhatsApp may disconnect the session if:
- The phone's internet connection is unstable
- You manually unlink the device from WhatsApp
- The session token expires (rare)

To fix:
1. Delete the `.whatsapp-auth/` directory
2. Restart the connector
3. Scan the QR code again

### Bot Not Responding

1. Check that the connector is running and shows "WhatsApp connected!"
2. Verify the message starts with the trigger (`!oc`)
3. If using `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS`, verify your sender ID from the `[MSG]` log prefix is in the list
4. Check the logs for errors

### Rate Limiting

The connector has built-in rate limiting (default: 5 seconds between messages per user). This prevents abuse and API throttling.

## Security Notes

- **Keep `.whatsapp-auth/` secure** - it contains session keys
- **Never commit `.whatsapp-auth/` to git** - it's in `.gitignore` by default
- Use `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` to restrict access in production
- The linked WhatsApp account should be a dedicated number, not your personal account
- Review the [Security documentation](SECURITY.md) for permission model details

## Limitations

- **No group support** - Currently responds only to direct messages
- **Text only input** - Voice messages and images from users are not processed
- **Document output** - The bot can send PDF, CSV, XLSX and other documents as file attachments via `[DOCLIBRARY_DOC]` markers
- **Single account** - One WhatsApp account per connector instance
